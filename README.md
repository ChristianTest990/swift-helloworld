#Swift HelloWorld App Overview
This is the **develop** branch and this page is under construction.

This project contains a simple Swift hello world application that can be deployed to Bluemix or run locally on your [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/) or [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) system.  This sample application creates a basic server that returns an HTML greeting to the client.  Please note that this is not a production-ready application.  Instead, it is for educational purposes to learn about the types of applications you can develop using the Swift programming language.

To push this application to Bluemix, please use the following command:

`cf push -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/swift-buildpack.git`
